 * The algorithm will start by sorting the array, and then iterating over it.
 * Starting at the first event, each of its siblings and children, placed in
 * groups of siblings, will be found. Both are needed in order to calculate the
 * width of the first event. When the width is known, its siblings will be
 * given the same width, but with an incremental x-offset.
 *
 * Each group of children will be looking to move as far away from its original
 * parent as possible. A move can be made to one of the parent's siblings, if
 * that sibling is also a parent to the child group. This will make room for
 * more events.
 *
 * When a child group knows its parent, it looks at the space occupied by that
 * parent, and calculates the remaning available space and divides that among
 * each other.
 *
 * All widths and x-offsets are calculated without taking overlapping into
 * account. Overlapping is added in the end according to the OVERLAP_MULTIPLIER.
 * If that is set to 0, the events won't overlap or grow.
 *
 * When one of these rounds are finished, all events connected have been
 * traversed, so the cursor will be moved past all of them.
